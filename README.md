# React UI Components Assignment

This project contains two reusable React components built with TypeScript and TailwindCSS:

1. **InputField** - Flexible input with validation, loading state, and light/dark support.
2. **DataTable** - Tabular data display with sorting, row selection, loading and empty states.

All components are documented in Storybook.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone <repo-url>
2. Install dependencies:
   yarn
3. Run the project:
   yarn dev
4. Run Storybook:
   yarn storybook

## Approach

- Used **TailwindCSS** for styling and light/dark theme.
- InputField supports multiple variants, sizes, and states.
- DataTable supports column sorting, row selection (single/multiple), loading, and empty states.
- Components are fully typed with **TypeScript**.
- Storybook added for component documentation and interactive testing.
